# Lab 7 Steps

Here is how you can run a Python script that I created, which uses a plugin called Beautifulsoup4

First, install the requests module and Beautifulsoup. Make sure you have python downloaded and use powershell to run

```python
pip install requests
pip install Beautifulsoup4
```

Now, find a website you want to scrape

Enter your url into the script

Now, in Python, run the following code:

```python
from PIL import Image,ImageFilter
myImage = Image.open('/full/path/to/image.jpg')
myImage.load
```
